Since the outbreak of COVID-19 in December 2019, many students and teachers have been forced to use remote learning more frequently.  To improve remote learning outcomes, increasing students' engagement with learning is highly desirable.  In this project, the team created an educational ChatBot to actively engage learners with the learning material and make the learning process more fun.  The project shows that a carefully designed ChatBot can serve as a low-cost AI teaching engagement tool to help teachers and improve the remote learning experience for students.
